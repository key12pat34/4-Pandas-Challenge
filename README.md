PyCity Schools Conclusions:

1. The school district is collectively failing with seven out of fifteen schools all hovering around the 50% overall passing.

2. The top performing schools are all charter schools and are likely to pass overall. The bottom performing schools are all district schools, and are likely to fail overall.

3. Charter schools have lower total students counts which can lead us to conclude that due to the lower count of students, each student is mroe liekly to get a more 'one-on-one'/"direct" educational experience with their instructors. Compared to charter schools, distrct schools have nearly double the count of students per school, so each instruction cannot provide the same "one-on-one" type services.

4. we can also conclude that as the spending range per student, AND school size goes UP the overall passing scores go DOWN.
